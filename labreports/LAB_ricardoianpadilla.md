https://www.indeed.com/  and  https://www.linkedin.com/
## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 17 |This site was strait to the point but was alittle too dull and could have added ways to make the user do less work when it cam to uplouding the resume.Because the resume is require to use this site I feel it should have been apart of the regristration process instead of the user having to find it in the setting on profile.|
| Linkedin | 18.5 | Over all this was a great site, but with a few flaws of adding unnecessary option based on the users intention. |

|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? |  3.0 |  It was a pretty normal sign-up, navigating through the page was easy. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2.0  |  It has things that weren't necessary for the signup. If I have to click skip more than 3 times its too much(especially if it doesn't correlate with the signup process).But outside the sign-up process it seem fast.|

| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2.0 |  Yes it did but in signup showing the user it connect option showing what linkedin is known for but outside of the sign in process the user is free to take any path they want.|
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |  3.0 | Overall this site was well off  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |  2.5 | Navigation was easy and fast to learn. But there was still learning involved |

| **TOTAL** |  18.5|   |
